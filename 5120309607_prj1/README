________________________________________________
header.h 
	common header
syntax_tree.h
	syntax tree
tokens_prj1.l
	tokenize input code
smallc_prj1.y
	construct syntax tree and print result
________________________________________________

use program as:
./compiler ./tesecase/test1.txt ./testcase/output

My program will save a list of all the tokens , with one token per line to ./testcase/output

and it will also save grammer tree in ./testcase/output
 
________________________________________________

There is one mistake in smallc grammer.

It does't seperate struct and INT
so that statement like:

struct a=1;

will be treated as legal.
by following rules;
DEF →SPEC DECS SEMI
DECS →DEC
DEC → VAR ASSIGNOP INIT
INIT →EXP
EXP →INT


So a way to solve this issue is to 
distinguish DEF as:
for int
DEF →TYPE DECS SEMI

and for struct
SDEF →STSPEC SDECS SEMI
